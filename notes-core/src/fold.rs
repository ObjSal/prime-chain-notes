//! Honest-fee-label prediction: whether a FIXED, already-known coin
//! selection will fold a sub-dust leftover into the fee instead of paying
//! it out as a discretionary change output — the with-change/no-change
//! decision every builder in `tx.rs` makes
//! (`build_note_tx_with_change`/`_exact`, `build_note_tx_mixed_exact`/
//! `_anchored`: `if !change && change_value > DUST_LIMIT { continue }`,
//! i.e. a leftover too small to be its own output rides along on top of
//! the fee instead). Without a UI split, a tiny selection's fee reads as
//! unexplainably high (Sal hit this on testnet4: a single 330-sat coin
//! composed a valid tx whose whole value went to "fee").
//!
//! Ported from chain-notes-app's `app-core/src/mixed.rs`
//! (`predict_fold`/`predict_notebook_fold`/`predict_funded_fold`,
//! 2026-07-18) onto THIS crate's own estimators, so the Prime device shows
//! the identical honest split its Mac/mobile sibling does. Pure
//! prediction only — nothing here builds or signs a transaction; every
//! function is pin-tested in `tests/fold.rs` against this crate's real
//! builders so the split shown before signing always matches what the
//! signed tx actually pays.
