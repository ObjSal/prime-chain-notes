**Bitcoin · Notes** — personal notes on the bitcoin blockchain, written from a device that has no network on purpose.

Compose a note on your Passport Prime, seal it with a key only your seed can re-derive — or leave it deliberately public — and the app builds and signs a real bitcoin transaction carrying the note. An online companion page broadcasts it and scans the chain; the device and the companion exchange nothing but files and QR codes. Your address history *is* the notebook: wipe the device, restore your seed, rescan the chain — every note comes back, private ones decrypted, with nothing stored anywhere else.

Keep as many **notebooks** as you like — each is its own address, derived from the same device seed, with its own notes, balance, and name. Sort a life's worth of notes: one for gifts, one for a project, one you'll archive when it's done.

## Features

- **Notebooks** — keep separate notebooks, each a distinct address derived from your one device seed, each with its own notes, balance, and name; create or archive them as your life needs, and filter a notebook's notes by who sent them.
- **A backup you can read** — your notebooks derive from a 24-word recovery phrase the device shows on demand, as words or a SeedQR. Write it down once and your funds restore in *any* bitcoin wallet and your notes in this app — no Passport required. Keep separate **accounts** for separate lives, and if a phrase is ever exposed, switch to a fresh one.
- **Every key, when you need it** — a Settings *Dangerous area* reveals your keys grouped by risk: **public** (account xpub + a `tr()` descriptor — watch-only, safe to share) and **private** (recovery words, and any notebook's hex/WIF), each scannable as a QR to import elsewhere. The device deliberately never shows a whole-account private key — the 24 words already restore everything.
- **Public or private** — private notes are sealed with modern authenticated encryption before they ever leave the device; public notes are plain text for the world to read.
- **Notes to other people** — composing starts at a **contacts picker**: yourself, recent addresses (nameable), a QR scan, or manual entry. Directed notes reach any taproot address like unstoppable, uncensorable mail; private directed notes can be read by exactly two devices — yours and theirs — and both can recover them from bare chain data after a wipe.
- **A gift inside** — directed notes can carry a chosen amount of sats to the recipient, from the minimum dust up to whatever you like.
- **Live cost while you type** — the compose screen re-prices on every keystroke with economy/normal/fast fee tiers or a custom rate, and the estimate is byte-exact against the transaction that actually gets signed.
- **Sync without a cable** — bundles come in by animated QR straight to the device camera; signed transactions go out as a QR the companion scans with your webcam. Files and the Airlock volume cover the big transfers.
- **Coins, sweep & consolidate** — a wallet-wide Coins screen across every notebook, one-tap consolidate into a single coin, and a guided sweep that empties the whole wallet to any address you pick — all one transaction, all signed on-device.
- **Every network** — mainnet, testnet4, signet, and regtest as one wallet-wide setting; each notebook keeps a separate ledger per chain, and the relay policy is verified live on testnet4.

## The companion

**Hosted at [objsal.github.io/chain-notes-companion](https://objsal.github.io/chain-notes-companion/)** — the online half, and no more than that: it builds sync bundles from public chain data and broadcasts what the device signed. It never sees a key.

- **Sync & broadcast** (`index.html`) — builds bundles (shown as a file or a static/animated QR) and broadcasts the device's transactions, via mempool.space or your own local node.
- **Read-only viewer** (`viewer.html`) — renders any address's on-chain notes in the browser: public notes as text, private ones as sealed placeholders. Decryption stays on the device by design.
- **Note permalinks** (`note.html`) — share a link to a single note.

## Get it running

With the Foundation SDK installed, build and launch in the simulator with:

```bash
